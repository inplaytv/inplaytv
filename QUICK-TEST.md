## üìä Current Status Check

Run through this checklist:

## üéØ Most Likely Scenario

**Email confirmation is DISABLED** 

This means:

**Try this:**
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Email: [your signup email]
3. Password: [your signup password]
4. Click "Sign in"
5. You should be logged in! ‚úÖ
```
