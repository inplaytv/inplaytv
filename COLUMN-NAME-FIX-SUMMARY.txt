=== FILES USING WRONG COLUMN NAMES (round1_tee_time) ===

Need to change: round1_tee_time → round_1_start (etc.)

GOLF APP:
1. apps/golf/src/app/leaderboards/page.tsx (many lines)
2. apps/golf/src/app/api/tournaments/[slug]/tee-times/route.ts
3. apps/golf/src/app/api/tournaments/[slug]/leaderboard/route.ts
4. apps/golf/src/app/api/notifications/notify-inplay/route.ts

=== FILES USING CORRECT COLUMN NAMES (round_1_start) ===

Already correct - NO changes needed:

GOLF APP:
- apps/golf/src/app/api/tournaments/[slug]/one-2-one/route.ts ✅
- apps/golf/src/app/api/one-2-one/instances/available/route.ts ✅
- apps/golf/src/app/api/one-2-one/join/route.ts ✅

ADMIN APP:
- apps/admin/src/app/tournaments/TournamentsList.tsx ✅
- apps/admin/src/app/tournament-lifecycle/page.tsx ✅
- apps/admin/src/app/api/tournaments/[id]/competitions/calculate-times/route.ts ✅

=== ADMIN COMPETITION FORM (THE KEY ISSUE) ===

WRONG:
- apps/admin/src/app/tournaments/[id]/page.tsx line 1242
  Uses: `round_${roundStart}_start`
  This looks correct BUT tournament object doesn't have these columns loaded!

Need to check what the tournament SELECT statement is fetching.
