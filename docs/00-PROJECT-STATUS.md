## Project Structure

```
apps/web     - Public website + auth (ACTIVE)
apps/app     - Game client (NOT CREATED)
apps/dashboard - Admin panel (NOT CREATED)
packages/ui  - Shared components (STUB)
packages/config - Shared configs (ACTIVE)
design/      - HTML mockups (REFERENCE ONLY)
```

## Key Decisions

- **No Tailwind CSS** - Using vanilla CSS
- **No test frameworks yet** - Will add later
- **No server actions** - Client-side only for now
- **Minimal dependencies** - Keeping it lean
- **Supabase for backend** - Auth + DB + Realtime
