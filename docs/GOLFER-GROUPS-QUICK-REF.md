# 🎯 Golfer Groups - Quick Reference

## 🚨 FIRST: Run This Migration
**File**: `scripts/2025-01-golfer-groups-system.sql`
**Where**: Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
**Result**: Creates 5 tables + 10 sample golfers + 4 sample groups

---

## 📖 What Is This?

A **group-based system** for managing tournament golfers. Instead of adding 96 golfers one-by-one, you:
1. Create a group (e.g., "Masters 2025 Full Field")
2. Add 96 golfers to the group
3. Assign group to tournament in 1 click
4. Link group golfers to specific competitions

**Efficiency**: 96 individual clicks → 3 clicks = **97% faster** ✅

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

```
Individual Golfers (156 in database)
    ↓
Groups (e.g., "Masters Full Field")
    ↓
Tournament (assigns groups)
    ↓
Competitions (uses specific golfers from groups)
```

**Example**:
- Round 1-2: Full field (96 golfers)
- Round 3-4: After cut (50 golfers)
