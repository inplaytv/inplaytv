## ‚ùì **FAQ**

### **Q: What if email verification is disabled?**
A: App still works! Users are logged in immediately after signup.

### **Q: Can users signup on desktop and verify on phone?**
A: Yes! That's the whole point - cross-device compatible.

### **Q: What happens if user doesn't verify email?**
A: They can't login until they verify. They'll see: "Please verify your email before logging in."

### **Q: Can we resend verification emails?**
A: Yes! Supabase has built-in resend functionality. We can add a "Resend verification" button if needed.

### **Q: Are magic links completely removed?**
A: Yes! They're removed because they don't work cross-device with Supabase's PKCE implementation.
