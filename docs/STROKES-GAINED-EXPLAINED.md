# 🏌️ Strokes Gained Explained - A Simple Guide

## What is Strokes Gained?

**Strokes Gained (SG)** is the most advanced golf statistic that answers one simple question: *"How much better or worse is this player compared to the average PGA Tour player?"*

Think of it like this:
- **0.0 = Average PGA Tour performance** (the baseline)
- **Positive numbers (+) = Better than average** (gaining strokes on the field)
- **Negative numbers (-) = Worse than average** (losing strokes to the field)

## 📊 Understanding the Numbers

### What Do SG Numbers Mean?

| SG Value | What It Means | Player Level |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **+2.5 or higher** | Elite performance | Top 10 players in the world |
| **+1.5 to +2.5** | Excellent | Top 30 players |
| **+0.5 to +1.5** | Very good | Top 50-75 players |
| **-0.5 to +0.5** | Average | Middle of the pack (75-125 rank) |
| **-1.0 to -0.5** | Below average | Struggling to maintain card |
| **-1.5 or lower** | Poor | Bottom tier players |

### Real-World Example

If a player has **SG Total: +1.2**, it means:
- Over 4 rounds (72 holes), they would beat the average PGA Tour player by **4.8 strokes**
- That's almost 5 shots better than half the field!
- This player would likely finish in the top 20-30

## 🎯 The 5 Main SG Categories

Golf is broken down into 5 key areas. Here's what each measures:

### 1. **SG: Off-the-Tee (SG:OTT)** 🏌️‍♂️
**What it measures:** Driving performance (distance + accuracy)

**Simple explanation:** How good is the player at hitting tee shots?
- Measures both how far AND how straight they hit it
- Includes driver on par 4s/5s, and tee shots on par 3s

**Example:**
- **Rory McIlroy: +0.8** = Elite driver, long and accurate
- **Average player: 0.0** = Hits it middle of the pack
- **Shorter hitter: -0.5** = Giving up distance to the field

---

### 2. **SG: Approach (SG:APP)** 🎯
**What it measures:** Iron play and approach shots to the green

**Simple explanation:** How close does the player hit it to the pin?
- Measures shots from the fairway or rough to the green
- Includes all iron shots, hybrids, and fairway woods into greens
- The MOST important stat for winning tournaments

**Example:**
- **Justin Thomas: +1.2** = Sticks it close, makes tons of birdies
- **Average player: 0.0** = Hits greens but not super close
- **Wild player: -0.8** = Misses greens often or leaves long putts

---

### 3. **SG: Around the Green (SG:ARG)** 🏌️
**What it measures:** Short game (chipping, pitching, bunker play)

**Simple explanation:** How good is the player at getting up and down when they miss the green?
- Measures all shots within 30 yards of the green
- Includes chips, pitches, flop shots, and bunker shots

**Example:**
- **Jordan Spieth: +0.5** = Scrambles like crazy, saves par often
- **Average player: 0.0** = Gets up and down half the time
- **Poor chipper: -0.6** = Loses strokes around the greens

---

### 4. **SG: Putting (SG:PUTT)** ⛳
**What it measures:** Putting performance

**Simple explanation:** How many putts does it take compared to average?
- Accounts for distance (10-foot putt vs 30-foot putt)
- Shows if a player is making or missing putts they should make

**Example:**
- **Scottie Scheffler: +0.8** = Drains everything, rarely 3-putts
- **Average player: 0.0** = Makes expected putts, sometimes hot
- **Cold putter: -0.5** = Leaves putts short, 3-putts too much

---

### 5. **SG: Tee-to-Green (SG:T2G)** 🏌️‍♂️➡️⛳
**What it measures:** Everything EXCEPT putting

**Simple explanation:** Combined performance of driving, irons, and short game
- **SG:T2G = SG:OTT + SG:APP + SG:ARG**
- Shows ball-striking ability (without putting influence)

**Example:**
- **Collin Morikawa: +2.0** = Elite ball-striker
- **Average player: 0.0** = Average ball-striking
- **Poor ball-striker: -1.0** = Struggles to hit quality shots

---

### 6. **SG: Total** 🏆
**What it measures:** EVERYTHING combined

**Simple explanation:** The ultimate measure of overall performance
- **SG:Total = SG:OTT + SG:APP + SG:ARG + SG:PUTT**
- The single best stat to predict success

**Example:**
- **Scottie Scheffler (when #1): +2.8** = Dominating the field
- **Average tour player: 0.0** = Breaking even
- **Player missing cuts: -2.0** = Losing 8 strokes per tournament

---

## 📈 Time Periods Explained

We track Strokes Gained over different time periods to understand **form and trends**:

### **Last 5 Rounds (L5)**
- **What it shows:** Current hot/cold streak
- **Why it matters:** Shows if a player is peaking right now
- **Example:** If L5 is much higher than career average = **HOT** 🔥

### **Last 20 Rounds (L20)**
- **What it shows:** Recent form (last 2-3 months)
- **Why it matters:** Most predictive for upcoming performance
- **Example:** Used to identify players trending up or down

### **Career Average**
- **What it shows:** Long-term skill level
- **Why it matters:** Shows true talent level over time
- **Example:** Filters out lucky/unlucky stretches

---

## 🔥 Form Status Explained

We classify players into 3 categories based on recent performance:

### **HOT 🔥**
**Definition:** L5 average is **+0.5 or higher** than career average

**What it means:**
- Player is in exceptional form right now
- Playing significantly better than their normal level
- Great time to bet on them or pick them for fantasy

**Example:**
- Career: +0.5
- L5: +1.2
- **Difference: +0.7** → HOT!

---

### **COLD ❄️**
**Definition:** L5 average is **-0.5 or lower** than career average

**What it means:**
- Player is struggling compared to their usual level
- Might be injured, tired, or just in a slump
- Risky time to pick them

**Example:**
- Career: +1.0
- L5: +0.3
- **Difference: -0.7** → COLD!

---

### **NEUTRAL ➡️**
**Definition:** L5 is within **0.5 strokes** of career average

**What it means:**
- Player is performing at their normal level
- No hot streak or slump
- Predictable performance

**Example:**
- Career: +0.8
- L5: +0.9
- **Difference: +0.1** → NEUTRAL

---

## 📊 Momentum Score

**Momentum = L5 - L20**

Shows if a player is **trending up or down**:

| Momentum | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **+0.5 or higher** | Trending up! Getting better |
| **+0.1 to +0.5** | Slight improvement |
| **-0.1 to +0.1** | Steady (no change) |
| **-0.1 to -0.5** | Slight decline |
| **-0.5 or lower** | Trending down! Getting worse |

**Example:**
- L5: +1.5
- L20: +0.8
- **Momentum: +0.7** → Player is on fire, improving fast!

---

## 🎯 How to Use This Information

### For Fantasy Golf
1. Look for **HOT** players (recent L5 spike)
2. Check **Momentum** (positive = trending up)
3. Prioritize high **SG:APP** (approach is king)
4. Avoid **COLD** players unless they're cheap

### For Betting
1. Compare **L20 averages** between players
2. Favor players with positive **Momentum**
3. Check course history + current form
4. Look for undervalued players trending up

### For Understanding Tournaments
1. Leaders usually have **SG:Total +2.0 or higher**
2. Winners average **+2.5 to +3.5** for the week
3. Making the cut requires about **-0.5 or better**
4. Missing cuts usually means **-2.0 or worse**

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **SG:Total** is the best single stat to evaluate a player
2. **0.0 = Average**, positive is good, negative is bad
3. **L5 vs Career** shows if they're hot or cold right now
4. **Momentum** shows if they're trending up or down
5. **SG:APP** (approach) is the most important category for winning
6. Each **+1.0 SG** = gaining **4 strokes per tournament** (4 rounds)

---

## 📚 Why This Matters

Traditional stats like scoring average are misleading because:
- Easy courses = lower scores (doesn't mean better play)
- Hard courses = higher scores (doesn't mean worse play)
- Doesn't account for course difficulty or field strength

**Strokes Gained solves this** by comparing every shot to PGA Tour average in that exact situation:
- Same distance
- Same lie (fairway, rough, bunker)
- Same conditions
- Adjusted for course difficulty

It's the fairest way to measure golf performance! 🏆

## 🎓 Advanced Tip

Watch these combinations for peak performance:

1. **Elite T2G + Good Putting** = Tournament winner
   - Example: SG:T2G +2.0, SG:PUTT +0.8 = Likely champion

2. **Hot Putter + Average Ball-Striking** = One-week wonder
   - Example: SG:T2G -0.3, SG:PUTT +2.5 = Flash in the pan

3. **Great Driver + Great Irons** = Long-term success
   - Example: SG:OTT +1.0, SG:APP +1.5 = Elite player

4. **Poor Approach** = Hard to win
   - No matter how good everything else is, if SG:APP is negative, winning is very difficult
