# Golf Course Background Setup

This folder should contain your golf course background images.

## Quick Start:
1. Add 1-3 golf course images to this folder
2. Name them:
   - `golf-course-teal.jpg` (for teal theme)
   - `golf-course-green.jpg` (for green theme) 
   - `golf-course-blue.jpg` (for blue theme)

## Or use any names and update the CSS:
- Edit `styles.css` 
- Find the `background-image` lines
- Change the filenames to match yours

## Image Sources:
You can find great golf course images at:
- Unsplash.com (free high-quality photos)
- Your local golf courses
- Golf photography websites
- Stock photo sites

## Current Status:
ðŸ”„ **No images detected** - Add your images here to see backgrounds!

Once you add images, they will automatically appear as blurred, darkened backgrounds that enhance the golf theme while keeping text readable.
